        ----------
        image : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like or array-like
            The image to be parsed. If None, defaults to class' own
            image attribute.
        disp_axis
            The index of the image's dispersion axis. Should not be
            changed until operations can handle variable image
            orientations.
        mask_treatment

            The accepted values are:

            - ``apply``: The image remains unchanged, and any existing mask is combined\
                with a mask derived from non-finite values.
            - ``ignore``: The image remains unchanged, and any existing mask is dropped.
            - ``propagate``: The image remains unchanged, and any masked or non-finite pixel\
                causes the mask to extend across the entire cross-dispersion axis.
            - ``zero_fill``: Pixels that are either masked or non-finite are replaced with 0.0,\
                and the mask is dropped.
            - ``nan_fill``:  Pixels that are either masked or non-finite are replaced with nan,\
                and the mask is dropped.
            - ``apply_mask_only``: The  image and mask are left unmodified.
            - ``apply_nan_only``: The  image is left unmodified, the old mask is dropped, and a\
                new mask is created based on non-finite values.
