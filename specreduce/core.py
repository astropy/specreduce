        Convert all accepted image types to a consistently formatted Spectrum1D object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like or array-like
            The image to be parsed. If None, defaults to class' own
            image attribute.
        disp_axis
            The index of the image's dispersion axis. Should not be
            changed until operations can handle variable image
            orientations. [default: 1]
        mask_treatment
            The method for handling masked or non-finite data. Choice of ``filter``,
            ``omit``, or ``zero-fill``. If ``filter`` is chosen, masked and non-finite
            data will not contribute to the background statistic that is calculated
            in each column along `disp_axis`. If `omit` is chosen, columns along
            disp_axis with any masked/non-finite data values will be fully masked
            (i.e, 2D mask is collapsed to 1D and applied). If ``zero-fill`` is chosen,
            masked/non-finite data will be replaced with 0.0 in the input image,
            and the mask will then be dropped. For all three options, the input mask
            (optional on input NDData object) will be combined with a mask generated
            from any non-finite values in the image data.
