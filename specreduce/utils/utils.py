def measure_cross_dispersion_profile(image, trace=None, crossdisp_axis=0,
                                     width=None, pixel=None, pixel_range=None,
                                     statistic='median', align_along_trace=True):
    """
    Return a 1D (quantity) array of the cross-dispersion profile measured at a
    specified pixel value ('wavelength', but potentially before calibration),
    or the average profile across several pixel values (or range of pixel values)
    along the dispersion axis.

    If a single number is specified for `pixel`, then the profile at that pixel
    (i.e wavelength) will be returned. If several pixels are specified in a list or
    array, then they will be averaged (median or mean, set by `statistic` which
    defaults to median). Alternatively, `pixel_range` can be specified as a tuple
    of integers specifying the minimum and maximum pixel range to average the
    profile. `pixel` and `pixel_range` cannot be set simultaneously, and the default
    is `pixel_range`=(min_image, max_image) to return an average profile across the
    entire wavelength range of the image.

    The window in the cross dispersion axis for measuring the profile at
    the pixel(s) specified is determined by `width` and `trace`. If a trace is
    provided (either as a Trace object, or as a number specifying the location
    on the cross-dispersion axis of a FlatTrace object) that will determine the
    center of the profile on the cross-dispersion axis. Otherwise, if `trace`
    is None, the center of the image will be the center of the returned profile
    (i.e., the center row assuming a horizontal trace).

    If `width` is none, a window size of half the image in the cross-dispersion
    axis will be used to measure the cross dispersion profile. Otherwise, an
    integer value can be set for `width` which will determine the size of the
    window around the trace used to measure the profile (this window moves with
    the trace if trace is not flat).

    By default, if a non-flat trace is used the image will be aligned along the
    trace. This can be controlled with the 'align_along_trace' parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like or array-like, required
        2D image to measure cross-dispersion profile.
    trace : Trace object, int, float, or None
        A Trace object, a number to specify a FlatTrace, or None to use the
        middle of the image. This is the position that defines the center of the
        cross-dispersion profile. [default: None]
    crossdisp_axis : int, optional
        The index of the image's cross-dispersion axis. [default: 0]
    width : tuple of int or None
        Width around 'trace' to calculate profile. If None, then all rows in the
        cross-dispersion axis will be used. [default: None]
    pixel: int, list of int, or None
        Pixel value(s) along the dispersion axis to return cross-dispersion profile.
        If several specified in list, then the average (method set by `statistic`)
        profile will be calculated. If None, and `pixel_range` is set, then
        `pixel_range` will be used. [default: None]
    pixel_range: tuple of int or None
        Tuple of (min, max) defining the pixel range (along dispersion axis) to
        calculate average cross-dispersion profile, up to and not inclusive of max.
        If None, and `pixel` is not None, `pixel` will be used. If None and `pixel`
        is also None, this will be interpreted as using the entire dispersion axis
        to generate an average profile for the whole image. [default: None]
    statistic: 'median' or 'mean'
        If `pixel` specifies multiple pixels, or `pixel_range` is specified, an
        average profile will be returned. This can be either `median` (default)
        or `mean`. This is ignored if only one pixel is specified. [default: median]
    align_along_trace: bool
        Relevant only for non-flat traces. If True, "roll" each column so that
        the trace sits in the central row before calculating average profile. This
        will prevent any 'blurring' from averaging a non-flat trace at different
        pixel/wavelengths. [default: True]
