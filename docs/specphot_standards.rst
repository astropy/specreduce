Spectrophotometric Standards
============================

Introduction
------------

Instrument sensitivity as a function of wavelength is calibrated using observations of
spectrophotometric standard stars. `~specreduce` offers some convenience functions for accessing
some databases of commonly used standard stars and loading the data into `~specutils.Spectrum1D`
instances.

Supported Databases
-------------------

Probably the best curated database of spectrophotometric calibration data is the
`CALSPEC <https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/reference-data-for-calibration-and-tools/astronomical-catalogs/calspec>`_
database at `MAST <https://archive.stsci.edu/>`_ (Ref.: Bohlin, Gordon, & Tremblay 2014). It also
has the advantage of including data that extends both well into the UV and the IR. The `~specreduce.calibration_data.load_MAST_calspec`
function provides a way to easily load CALSPEC data either directly from MAST (https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/cdbs/calspec/)
or from a previously downloaded local file. Here is an example of how to use it and of a CALSPEC standard that has both UV and IR coverage:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from specreduce.calibration_data import load_MAST_calspec

    spec = load_MAST_calspec("agk_81d266_stisnic_007.fits")

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.step(spec.spectral_axis, spec.flux, where="mid")
    ax.set_yscale('log')
    ax.set_xlabel(f"Wavelength ({spec.spectral_axis.unit})")
    ax.set_ylabel(f"Flux ({spec.flux.unit})")
    ax.set_title("AGK+81 266")
    fig.show()


- bstdscal:     Directory of the brighter KPNO IRS standards (i.e. those
                with HR numbers) at 29 bandpasses, data from various
                sources transformed to the Hayes and Latham system,
                unpublished.
- ctiocal:      Directory containing fluxes for the southern tertiary
                standards as published by Baldwin & Stone, 1984, MNRAS,
                206, 241 and Stone and Baldwin, 1983, MNRAS, 204, 347.
- ctionewcal:   Directory containing fluxes at 50A steps in the blue range
                3300-7550A for the tertiary standards of Baldwin and
                Stone derived from the revised calibration of Hamuy et
                al., 1992, PASP, 104, 533.  This directory also contains
                the fluxes of the tertiaries in the red (6050-10000A) at
                50A steps as will be published in PASP (Hamuy et al
                1994).  The combined fluxes are obtained by gray
                shifting the blue fluxes to match the red fluxes in the
                overlap region of 6500A-7500A and averaging the red and
                blue fluxes in the overlap.  The separate red and blue
                fluxes may be selected by following the star name with
                "red" or "blue"; i.e. CD 32 blue.
- iidscal:      Directory of the KPNO IIDS standards at 29 bandpasses,
                data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and
                Latham system, unpublished.
- irscal:       Directory of the KPNO IRS standards at 78 bandpasses,
                data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and
                Latham system, unpublished (note that in this directory the
                brighter standards have no values - the `bstdscal` directory
                must be used for these standards at this time).
- oke1990:      Directory of spectrophotometric standards observed for use
                with the HST, Table VII, Oke 1990, AJ, 99. 1621 (no
                correction was applied).  An arbitrary 1A bandpass
                is specified for these smoothed and interpolated
                flux "points".
- redcal:       Directory of standard stars with flux data beyond 8370A.
                These stars are from the IRS or the IIDS directory but
                have data extending as far out into the red as the
                literature permits.  Data from various sources.
- spechayescal: The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at the Hayes flux
                points, Table IV, Spectrophotometric Standards, Massey
                et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315.
- spec16cal:    Directory containing fluxes at 16A steps in the blue
                range 3300-7550A for the secondary standards, published
                in Hamuy et al., 1992, PASP, 104, 533.  This directory
                also contains the fluxes of the secondaries in the red
                (6020-10300A) at 16A steps as will be published in PASP
                (Hamuy et al 1994).  The combined fluxes are obtained by
                gray shifting the blue fluxes to match the red fluxes in
                the overlap region of 6500A-7500A and averaging the blue
                and red fluxes in the overlap. The separate red and
                blue fluxes may be selected by following the star name
                with "red" or "blue"; i.e. HR 1544 blue.
- spec50cal:    The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at 50 A intervals.
                The data are from (1) Table V, Spectrophotometric Standards,
                Massey et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315 and (2) Table 3, The
                Kitt Peak Spectrophotometric Standards: Extension to 1
                micron, Massey and Gronwall, 1990, ApJ 358, p. 344.
