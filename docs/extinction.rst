Atmospheric Extinction
======================

Introduction
------------

The Earth's atmosphere is highly chromatic in its transmission of light. The wavelength-dependence
is dominated by scattering in the optical (320-700 nm) and molecular features in the near-infrared
and infrared.

Supported Optical Extinction Models
-----------------------------------

``specreduce`` offers support for average optical extinction models for a set of observatories:

1. The CTIO extinction curve was originally distributed with IRAF and comes from the work of
Stone & Baldwin (1983 MN 204, 347) plus Baldwin & Stone (1984 MN 206,
241).  The first of these papers lists the points from 3200-8370A while
the second extended the flux calibration from 6056 to 10870A but the
derived extinction curve was not given in the paper.  The IRAF table
follows SB83 out to 6436, the redder points presumably come from BS84
with averages used in the overlap region. More recent CTIO extinction
curves are shown as Figures in Hamuy et al (92, PASP 104, 533 ; 94 PASP
106, 566).

2. The KPNO extinction table was originally distributed with IRAF. The ultimate provenance of this data is unclear,
but it has been used as-is in this form for over 30 years.

In each case, the extinction is given in magnitudes per airmass and the wavelengths are in Angstroms. Here is an example that
uses the `~specreduce.calibration_data.AtmosphericExtinction` class to load each model and plots the extinction in magnitudes as well
as fractional transmission as a function of wavelength:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from specreduce.calibration_data import AtmosphericExtinction, SUPPORTED_EXTINCTION_MODELS

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
    for model in SUPPORTED_EXTINCTION_MODELS:
        ext = AtmosphericExtinction(model=model)
        ax[0].plot(ext.spectral_axis, ext.extinction_mag, label=model)
        ax[1].plot(ext.spectral_axis, ext.transmission)
    ax[0].legend(fancybox=True, shadow=True)
    ax[1].set_xlabel("Wavelength ($\AA$)")
    ax[0].set_ylabel("Extinction (mag)")
    ax[1].set_ylabel("Transmission")
    plt.tight_layout()
    fig.show()

A convenience class, `~specreduce.calibration_data.AtmosphericTransmission`, is provided for loading data files containing atmospheric transmission
versus wavelength. The common use case for this would be loading the output of telluric models. By default it loads a telluric model for an
airmass of 1 and 1 mm of precipitable water. Some resources for generating more realistic model atmospheric transmission spectra include
https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/1.0.0/documentation/html/index.html and http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/skytools/molecfit.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from specreduce.calibration_data import AtmosphericTransmission, SUPPORTED_EXTINCTION_MODELS

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ext_default = AtmosphericTransmission()
    ext_custom = AtmosphericTransmission(data_file="atm_transmission_secz1.5_1.6mm.dat")
    ax.plot(ext_default.spectral_axis, ext_default.transmission, label=r"sec $z$ = 1; 1 mm H$_{2}$O", linewidth=1)
    ax.plot(ext_custom.spectral_axis, ext_custom.transmission, label=r"sec $z$ = 1.5; 1.6 mm H$_{2}$O", linewidth=1)
    ax.legend(loc="upper center", bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.12), ncol=2, fancybox=True, shadow=True)
    ax.set_xlabel("Wavelength (microns)")
    ax.set_ylabel("Transmission")
    fig.show()
