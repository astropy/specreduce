Contributing
============

As with all `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org>`_ coordinated packages, **Specreduce** is
developed *by* the astrophysics community, *for* the astrophysics community. We warmly welcome
contributions of all kinds - whether it’s sharing feedback, reporting bugs, suggesting new
features, or contributing code and documentation - every level of involvement helps make the
package better for everyone.

Specreduce follows `Astropy development and contribution guidelines <https://docs.astropy
.org/en/latest/index_dev.html>`_ and the `Astropy Community Code of Conduct
<https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html>`_.

Please feel free to contribute code and suggestions through `GitHub. <https://github

Contribute tutorials

Tutorials and examples of use-cases are extremely welcome. While the main steps for spectroscopic
reduction (of long-slit spectra) are pretty much the same for any spectrograph and instrument
setup, the details and recipe for the best results can still vary.
