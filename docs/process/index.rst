Spectroscopic data reduction outline
************************************

Here are some examples of complete DR processes, to help guide development
(including basic image reduction steps, provided by other packages). These are
not a summary of functionality actually implemented in
`specreduce <https://specreduce.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ today.

Near-IR, multi-slit spectroscopy
================================

This example, from Gemini, is based on plans for the reduction of
near-infrared, multi-slit spectra (considering future use with optical data to
a lesser extent). Some adjustments might be needed as the functionality takes
form.
