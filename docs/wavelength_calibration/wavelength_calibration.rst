Wavelength Calibration
======================

In spectroscopy, the raw data from a detector typically records the intensity of light received
at different detector positions (pixels). However, for scientific analysis, we need to know the
physical wavelength (or frequency, or energy) corresponding to each pixel. **Wavelength
calibration** is the process of determining this relationship, creating a mapping function or
model  that converts pixel coordinates to wavelength values.

This is often achieved by observing a calibration source with well-known emission or absorption
lines at specific wavelengths (e.g., an arc lamp spectrum). By identifying the pixel positions of
these known spectral features, we can fit a mathematical model that describes the dispersion of
the spectrograph.

The ``specreduce`` library provides the `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D` class
to  facilitate this process for one-dimensional spectra. Tools for calibrating 2D spectra will
be introduced in a later version.

1D Wavelength Calibration
-------------------------

The `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D` class encapsulates the data and methods
needed to perform  1D wavelength calibration. The class supports multiple workflows with varying
levels of user interaction. It can be used:

*  manually in an interactive script or notebook,
*  as part of an interactive pipeline, or
*  as part of a fully automated pipeline.

The typical workflow involves these steps:

1.  **Initialization**: Create an instance of the class, providing either an observed arc lamp
    spectrum or pre-identified observed line  positions, along with a catalog of known line
    wavelengths. `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D` supports the use of multiple
    arc spectra, and the initialization can also be done using a list of arc spectra (or a
    list of line arrays identified from multiple arc spectra) and a list of catalogs for each arc
    spectra.
2.  **Line Identification (Optional)**: If arc spectra were provided, identify the pixel
    locations of emission lines within them.
3.  **Matching and Fitting**: Determine the correspondence between observed line pixels and
    catalog wavelengths, and fit a model (a polynomial) to represent the
    pixel-to-wavelength transformation. This can be done manually by providing matched pairs or
    automatically using global optimization techniques.
4.  **Inspection**: Evaluate the quality of the fit using residuals and diagnostic plots.
5.  **Applying the Solution**: Use the fitted model (often accessed as a `~gwcs.wcs.WCS` object) to
    calibrate science spectra or resample spectra onto a linear wavelength grid.

.. Tutorials
.. ---------

.. The following tutorials provide hands-on examples demonstrating the usage of the
   `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D` class. These step-by-step guides cover
   both basic and advanced functionality to help you get started with wavelength calibration.

Quickstart
----------

1. Initialization
*****************

You instantiate the :class:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D` by providing basic
information about your setup and data. A reference pixel (``ref_pixel``) is required, which serves
as the anchor point for the polynomial fit, and ``degree`` can be used to set the degree of the
polynomial for the fit.

You must provide *either* a list of arc spectra (or a single arc spectrum) *or* a list of known
observed line positions:

*   **Using an Arc Spectrum**: Provide the arc spectrum as a `specutils.Spectrum`
    object via the ``arc_spectra`` argument. You also need to provide a ``line_lists`` argument,
    which can be a list of known catalog wavelengths or the name(s) of standard line lists
    recognized by `specreduce` (e.g., ``"HeI"``).

    .. code-block:: python

        wc = WavelengthCalibration1D(ref_pixel=512,
                                     arc_spectra=arc_he,
                                     line_lists=["HeI"])

*   **Using multiple Arc Spectra**:

    .. code-block:: python

        wc = WavelengthCalibration1D(ref_pixel=512,
                                     arc_spectra=[arc_he, arc_hg_ar],
                                     line_lists=[["HeI"], ["HgI", "ArI"]])

*   **Using Observed Line Positions**: If you have already identified the pixel centroids of
    lines in your calibration spectrum, you can provide them directly via the ``obs_lines``
    argument (as a list of NumPy arrays). In this case, you *must* also provide the detector's pixel
    boundaries using ``pix_bounds`` (a tuple like ``(min_pixel, max_pixel)``). You still need to
    provide the ``line_lists`` containing the potential matching catalog wavelengths.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Assume observed line pixel centers were found previously
        obs_he = np.array([105.3, 210.8, 455.1, 512.5, 680.2])

        # Pixel range of the detector
        pixel_bounds = (0, 1024)

        wc = WavelengthCalibration1D(ref_pixel=512,
                                     obs_lines=obs_he,
                                     line_lists=["HeI"],
                                     pix_bounds=pixel_bounds)

*   **Using Observed Line Positions From Multiple Arcs**:

    .. code-block:: python

        obs_he = np.array([105.3, 210.8, 455.1, 512.5, 680.2])
        obs_hg_ar = np.array([234.2, 534.1, 768.2, 879.6])
        pixel_bounds = (0, 1024)

        wc = WavelengthCalibration1D(ref_pixel=512,
                                     obs_lines=[obs_he, obs_hg_ar],
                                     line_lists=[["HeI"], ["HgI", "ArI"]],
                                     pix_bounds=pixel_bounds)


2. Finding Observed Lines
*************************

If you initialized the class with ``arc_spectra``, you need to detect the lines in it. Use the
:meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.find_lines` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # Find lines with an estimated FWHM and noise factor
    wc.find_lines(fwhm=3.5, noise_factor=5)

    # Access the found lines (pixel positions)
    print(wc.observed_line_locations)

This populates the `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.observed_line_locations`
attribute.

3. Matching and Fitting the Solution
************************************

The core of the process is fitting the model that maps pixels to wavelengths.

*   **Global Fitting for Automated Pipelines**: If you have
    `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.observed_lines` (either found automatically or
    provided initially) and
    `~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.catalog_lines` (from ``line_lists``), but don't
    know the exact pixel-wavelength pairs, you can use
    :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.fit_global`. This method uses a global
    optimization algorithm to find the best-fit polynomial parameters by
    minimizing the distance between predicted line wavelengths and the nearest catalog lines. You
    need to provide estimated bounds for the wavelength and dispersion at the ``ref_pixel``.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Estimate wavelength and dispersion around the reference pixel
        # (e.g., Wavelength around 7500 AA, Dispersion ~2 AA/pix)
        wavelength_bounds = (7450, 7550)
        dispersion_bounds = (1.8, 2.2)

        wc.fit_global(wavelength_bounds, dispersion_bounds, popsize=30, refine_fit=True)

    Setting ``refine_fit=True`` automatically runs a least-squares refinement after the global
    fit finds an initial solution and matches lines.

*   **Fitting Known Pairs for an Interactive Workflow**: If you have already established explicit
    pairs of observed pixel centers and their corresponding known wavelengths, you can use
    :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.fit_lines` to perform a direct
    least-squares fit.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Assume these are matched pairs
        pixels = np.array([105.3, 512.5, 780.1])
        wavelengths = np.array([6965.43, 7503.87, 7723.76])

        wc.fit_lines(pixels=pixels, wavelengths=wavelengths, refine_fit=True)

    When ``refine_fit=True`` is set, the method automatically identifies matching pairs between
    observed and catalog lines, then performs a least-squares refinement using **all matching lines**.
    This goes beyond the subset of lines provided to :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.fit_lines`,
    resulting in a more complete wavelength calibration.

After fitting (either way), the pixel-to-wavelength
(`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.pix_to_wav`) and wavelength-to-pixel
(`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.wav_to_pix`) model transforms are calculated.

4. Inspecting the Fit
*********************

Several tools help assess the quality of the wavelength solution:

*   **RMS Error**: Calculate the root-mean-square error of the fit in wavelength or pixel units
    using :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.rms`.

    .. code-block:: python

        rms_wave = wc.rms(space='wavelength')
        rms_pix = wc.rms(space='pixel')
        print(f"Fit RMS (wavelength): {rms_wave}")
        print(f"Fit RMS (pixel): {rms_pix}")

*   **Plotting**: Visualize the fit and residuals:

    *   :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.plot_fit`: Shows the observed line
        positions mapped to the wavelength axis, overlaid with the catalog lines and the fitted
        solution. Also shows the fit residuals (observed - fitted wavelength) vs. pixel.
    *   :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.plot_residuals`: Plots residuals vs.
        pixel or vs. wavelength.
    *   :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.plot_observed_lines`: Plots the
        identified observed line positions (in pixels or mapped to wavelengths). Can optionally
        overlay the arc spectrum.
    *   :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.plot_catalog_lines`: Plots the catalog
        line positions (in wavelengths or mapped to pixels).

5. Using the Solution
*********************

Once satisfied with the fit, you can use the wavelength solution:

*   **Convert Coordinates**: Use :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.pix_to_wav` and
    :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.wav_to_pix` to convert between pixel and
    wavelength coordinates.

    .. code-block:: python

        pixels = np.array([100, 500, 900])
        wavelengths = wc.pix_to_wav(pixels)
        print(wavelengths)

*   **Get WCS Object**: Access the `~gwcs.wcs.WCS` object representing the solution via the
    :attr:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.gwcs` attribute. This is particularly
    useful for attaching the calibration to a :class:`~specutils.Spectrum` object.

*   **Rebin Spectrum**: Resample a spectrum onto a new wavelength grid using
    :meth:`~specreduce.wavecal1d.WavelengthCalibration1D.resample`. The rebinning is
    flux-conserving, meaning the total flux in the output spectrum matches the total flux
    in the input spectrum.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Resample the original arc spectrum onto a linear grid of 1000 points
        resampled_arc = ws.resample(arc_spectrum, nbins=1000)

        # The resampled spectrum now has a linear wavelength axis
        print(resampled_arc.spectral_axis)
