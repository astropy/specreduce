New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``Background`` has new methods for exposing the 1D spectrum of the background or
  background-subtracted regions [#143]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Improved errors/warnings when background region extends beyond bounds of image [#127]
- Fixed boxcar weighting bug that often resulted in peak pixels having weight
  above 1 and erroneously triggered overlapping background errors [#125]
- Fixed boxcar weighting to handle zero width and edge of image cases [#141]


1.1.0
-----

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``peak_method`` as an optional argument to ``KosmosTrace`` [#115]

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``HorneExtract`` no longer requires ``mask`` and ``unit`` arguments [#105]
- ``BoxcarExtract`` and ``HorneExtract`` now accept parameters (and require the image and trace)
  at initialization, and allow overriding any input parameters when calling [#117]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Corrected the default mask created in ``HorneExtract``/``OptimalExtract``
  when a user doesn't specify one and gives their image as a numpy array [#118]
